# Using CSS in React Components

* How do we use CSS in React? Just like in regular HTML, except for the use of `className` instead of `class`.
* Why `className`? Because `class` is a keyword in JavaScript.
* We also use bootstrap, which we install with `npm install --save-dev bootstrap` and reference via
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">`
* We also added some `div`-s and stuff to the `PersonComponent` to conform to what Bootstrap expects
